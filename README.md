# Supplementary Materials

This repository holds all supplementary source code needed to reproduce the calculations and plots of the research article “Aqueous geochemical and microbial variation across discrete depth intervals in a peridotite aquifer assessed using a packer system in the Samail Ophiolite, Oman” by Daniel B. Nothaft, Alexis S. Templeton, Eric S. Boyd, Juerg M. Matter, Martin Stute, Amelia N. Paukert Vankeuren, and The Oman Drilling Project Science Team. The article can be viewed on [ESSOAR](https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10506402.2).

The compiled analysis files are available as [HTML reports](https://danote.github.io/Oman-packers-2018-2019/).

We hope that this code, or any part of it, might prove useful to other members of the scientific community interested in the subject matter. All code is completely open-access and can be modified and repurposed in every way. If significant portions are reused in a scientific publication, please consider citing our work.
